description: Daily check-in - morning planning, midday adjustment, or evening review
---

Invoke the daily-planning skill for a context-aware check-in.

The skill will automatically determine whether this is:
- **Morning** check-in (plan the day)
- **Midday** adjustment (review progress, adjust priorities)
- **Evening** review (celebrate wins, close out day)

Based on:
- Current time (via getTimeInfo)
- Existing daily plan file
- Previous journal entries today

All responses in Swedish, all database operations via query scripts.
